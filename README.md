Maritime Weather Intelligence (MWI) – Weather Engine

##  Project Overview
Weather Engine is a maritime weather intelligence system designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in ocean navigation. Developed during the mariTHON hackathon, this project integrates real-time 
alerts, predictive analytics, and smart routing to support vessels across commercial, defense, and recreational sectors.

##  Team Members
 - Shashi Pandey(Team Lead)
- Akarshan Kumar 
- Shivani Negi
- Rudransh Nautiyal

##  Problem Statement
Shipping operations are highly sensitive to weather conditions, impacting schedules, fuel consumption, and crew safety. Our solution aims to:
- Deliver real-time weather alerts (cyclones, swells, currents)
- Predict future conditions up to 10 days
- Recommend optimal vessel speed based on weather variables
- Visualize data through an interactive dashboard
- Integrate trusted APIs (OpenWeather, NOAA, etc.)

##  Target Users
- Commercial Shipping
- Offshore Energy Platforms
- Naval & Defense Operations
- Port Authorities
- Fishing & Aquaculture
- Recreational Boating

##  Key Features
- Extreme Weather Detection: Automated alerts for storms and hazards
- Dynamic Routing: Suggests safest and most efficient paths
- Performance Modeling: Evaluates weather impact on speed and fuel
- Multi-Model Comparison: Selects best forecast model per region
- Hyperlocal Forecasts: Pinpoint data for ports and shipping lanes
